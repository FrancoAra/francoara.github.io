Welcome!
=================

I am a functional programmer located in the Amsterdam area. I run Purely Typed a software development consulting company specialized in distributed systems. I make efforts to train people in the fine arts of functional programming and mathematics for systems design.  And I work as much as possible on solving [another significant issue](https://medium.com/@franciscoarmburo/decision-systems-a-critical-challenge-be4bb1434fd1).

I offer a weekly meetup with limited attendance to give free training on functional programming and the usage of mathematics to understand and model computer systems, the topics I will be giving can be found in the next section. If you or your company are interested in longer training related to such topics, please do contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-miguel-ar%C3%A1mburo-torres-0a340485/).
